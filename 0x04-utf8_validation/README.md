# 0x04 UTF-8 Validation

* This project focuses on validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. To accomplish this, you will apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills.

## Concepts Needed
* Bitwise Operations in Python: Familiarize yourself with bitwise operations in Python, including AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).

## Python Bitwise Operators
UTF-8 Encoding Scheme: Understand the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes. Recognize the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.

The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets
Data Representation: Learn how to represent and work with data at the byte level. Understand how to handle the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

* List Manipulation in Python: Master iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
Python Lists
* Boolean Logic: Apply logical operations to make decisions within the program.
